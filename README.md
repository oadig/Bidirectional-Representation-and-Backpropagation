TensorFlow Implementation of  Bidirectional Representation and Backpropagation Learning with bipolar and binary permutation functions.

## Features

- [ ] Training a network on binary and bipolar permutation functions.
- [ ] The training can be forward only, backward only, or bidirectional.
- [ ] The network uses a single hidden layer.
